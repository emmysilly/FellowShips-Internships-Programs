# FellowShips-Internships-Programs
Hi! Use this repo to share and keep track of software and tech programs for the upcoming future! I was going to keep it on a seperate notes file but I thought why not share it with the world! If you would like to add or collaborate send me a DM on instagram @emelysilly

:warning: **This repository is only for internships/co-ops in the United States or for Remote positions:earth_americas:.**

ðŸ“ˆ For more tips on the internship process check out the [Zero to Offer program here](https://www.pittcs.wiki/zero-to-offer).ðŸ“ˆ
